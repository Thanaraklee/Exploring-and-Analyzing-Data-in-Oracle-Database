# In this four series
 We have learned about SQL in the form of Normal Query (Implicit Join) and how to utilize Common Table Expressions (WITH clause) and Views to handle complex data. We also explored various mathematical functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, and LISTAGG to perform calculations and format data. Additionally, we used the CASE statement to define conditions for categorizing data. The use of CTEs helped us write more concise and readable SQL statements.

## What are the gains from doing this project ?
We have gained a deeper understanding of SQL, particularly in the context of Normal Query (Implicit Join) and advanced techniques like CTEs and Views. We have learned how to perform complex data analysis, aggregate data, and present it in a meaningful way using various SQL functions. This project has equipped us with valuable skills in querying and manipulating data, enabling us to tackle more sophisticated data-related tasks in the future.
