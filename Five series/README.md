# In this five series
I have learned about functions and techniques for data manipulation in SQL, such as substring, INSTR, CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, INITCAP, RTRIM, LTRIM, TRIM, LENGTH, LPAD, RPAD, COALESCE, NVL, and TO_CHAR, to format and display data effectively.

## What are the gains from doing this project ?
The benefits include gaining knowledge and using existing SQL functions to solve problems and manage data in an organized and accurate manner when presenting information.
