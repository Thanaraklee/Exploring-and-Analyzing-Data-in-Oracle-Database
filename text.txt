The things learned from this series are the usage of SQL commands for retrieving data, combining data from multiple tables using JOIN, filtering data with WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, performing inline row-wise calculations, employing SUBQUERY, UNION ALL, and EXISTS for data selection, adding data with INSERT, as well as using DISTINCT and ORDER BY for efficient data sorting and filtering in SQL and data analysis approaches in databases.
