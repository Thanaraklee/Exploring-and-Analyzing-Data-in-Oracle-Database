# In this final series
In this final series, we have learned several important aspects of managing data in an SQL database:
- Splitting full names into first names and last names: We learned how to separate first names and last names from the FULL_NAME column and updated the FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME columns accordingly.f
- Correcting email addresses and phone numbers: We learned how to add ".com" to email addresses that were missing it and how to remove the dot and handle phone numbers with an incorrect number of digits.
- Updating and deleting data: We learned how to update data in the CUSTOMERS table to correct incorrect information and how to delete records from the ORDER_ITEMS table that were not associated with other tables.
- Converting data from BLOB: We learned how to read and convert data from the BLOB column and select various attributes to be presented as columns in a new table.


## What are the gains from doing this project ?
This project has provided us with a deep understanding and proficiency in efficiently managing data in an SQL database, including:
- Attribute separation: We learned how to extract attributes from JSON-formatted data stored in BLOB columns and use them to create sub-tables.
- Data correction: We learned how to correct inaccurate data, such as adding ".com" to missing email addresses and ensuring accurate phone numbers.
- Handling nested data: We learned how to convert complex nested data into a new table, making data access and analysis more straightforward.
- Deletion of incorrect data: We learned how to remove data that had no associations with other tables to maintain data integrity.
